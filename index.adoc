The five basic stats are subdivided into two stats each.

.The basic stats are calculated based on the sub-stats.
```
e.g.
body = (strength + power)/2
```

== Image

The image is generated dynamically based on the stats.
There are many images and combinations,
so it should be difficult to get the same card more than once.

=== Layout

The image consists of many small images that can be combined in any combination.

.Alternative Layouts
* Da Vinci's David like Wheel

=== Artwork

The artwork is based on the stats.
The higher the stat, the more extreme the depiction in the image.



When the two substats are balanced, the image shifts to a third way of expression to symbolize equilibrium.

== Game Mechanics

The attacker chooses the stat. The defender chooses the sub-stat.
Both battles are averaged and the winner is chosen based on who has the higher stat.

=== Leveling Cards
The winner gains points, the loser loses points. If the stat is zero, the card is lost entirely.

=== Gaining Cards
The winner can choose if he gets the card, or gains points on the winning card.

=== Progress
The player moves through a world of cards, that can be challenged. Sometimes the player is challenged as well.
